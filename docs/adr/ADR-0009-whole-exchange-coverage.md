# ADR-0009: Whole-exchange coverage (the resolvable universe)

## Status

Accepted (2026-07-01). Implements the long-standing "whole-exchange coverage" item
in [docs/BUILD-STATE.md](../BUILD-STATE.md) and Phase 2 of
[docs/global-exposure-architecture.md](../global-exposure-architecture.md) §5.
US-first, built as a market-plural framework so India (NSE/BSE) and UK (FTSE/LSE)
are new providers, not rewrites.

## Context

The graph held only ~53 curated companies, so a real retail brokerage book resolved
almost nothing — the retail blocker. We need the **full universe of listed issuers**
as lightweight nodes so an uploaded portfolio lands in the graph. This is the
*universe*, deliberately **not** deep filing ingestion (10-K/Exhibit-21/officers stays
curated and on-demand): the goal is that a ticker/name resolves to a node carrying
identity + venue, onto which sector/holdings/LEI edges are attached later.

The store already scales (Kùzu serving; O(E) ingest); the missing piece was the
bulk-registry *connector*. SEC publishes `company_tickers_exchange.json` — one
request returns ~10k issuers (ticker, CIK, name, exchange), free and clean. Crucially
we must **not** fan out to the per-CIK submissions API for 10k issuers.

## Decision

**A `coverage/` module with a `CoverageProvider` seam** (mirroring `screening/` and
`anchoring/`): `list_issuers() -> list[IssuerRecord]`. `UsEdgarCoverageProvider` reads
the one SEC feed (reusing the EDGAR `RateLimiter` + contact-bearing User-Agent);
`StaticCoverageProvider` replays fixtures so CI is hermetic. Design choices:

- **Generic per-market anchors (Invariant #2).** An `IssuerRecord` carries
  `IssuerAnchor{scheme, value}` — `cik`/`ticker` for US; the model already admits
  `isin`/`sedol`/`company_number`/`figi` so India/UK drop in with no schema change.
  The surrogate node key is **never** an external ID; the anchors ride *on* it.
- **CIK-reconcile: enrich, don't duplicate.** A bulk issuer whose CIK matches an
  existing Company node **enriches** it (adds ticker/exchange/universe anchors) and
  leaves the **curated GICS/name/source authoritative**. CIK is a near-perfect
  intra-US key, so this dedup is *exact*, not fuzzy — no reversible-resolver
  judgement is needed (nothing is being merged; anchors are added to one node).
- **Stable surrogate for the rest.** A new issuer becomes `us-<cik>` (unpadded),
  deterministic across re-runs so bookmarks survive.
- **Sector honesty (Invariant #5).** Bulk issuers carry no curated GICS → labelled
  `gics_status: unresolved`, never a fabricated sector. The coarse SIC can be layered
  later, clearly lower-authority.
- **Idempotent.** Descriptive fields enrich last-write-wins; identity anchors are
  first-write-wins; the surrogate key never moves. Provenance `sec-company-tickers`
  on every node; a per-market `CoverageRun` node records provider/counts/what was
  excluded upstream.
- **Exchange filter, honest.** Keep any named venue that is not OTC (so a future
  venue like "NYSE American" is included without a code change); blank/OTC listings
  are excluded **and counted by reason** — absence is signal, not a silent drop.
- **Proof it resolves books.** `coverage/resolve.py` resolves a brokerage CSV against
  the universe by exact **ticker** (with a punctuation-folded fallback: `BRK.B`↔`BRK-B`)
  then the shared **org-name** core matcher; unmatched positions are reported
  unresolved, never fabricated. The resolve *rate* is the headline metric.
- Wired as `coruscant coverage --market us [--file|--resolve]`, `runtime.run_coverage`,
  `GET /graph/coverage` (`coverage_overview`, counted live off the graph), and a
  golden cross-backend parity case.

## Consequences

- Runs hermetically in CI (parse/filter/reconcile are pure; the live fetch is
  operator-invoked with an injected/downloaded payload). **Live-validated:** the real
  SEC feed → 7,654 real-exchange issuers in ~1.5s (2,779 OTC/blank excluded and
  labelled) → the graph grew from 53 to **6,062 US companies** (1,645 enriched incl.
  multi-share-class rows collapsing onto one CIK node; 6,009 new surrogates). A
  12-line sample retail book resolved **10/12 (83%)** — TSLA/PLTR/GME, none previously
  covered, now resolve; the misses are an ETF (not in the issuer feed) and a bogus
  symbol, both honestly unresolved.
- Serving is unchanged: `run_coverage` writes the JSON snapshot; Kùzu rematerializes
  on the next `open_synced` (mtime-gated), like every other pipeline.
- Scale: ~10k nodes is comfortable for Kùzu (columnar) and the O(E) in-memory
  intermediate; reconciliation is O(N) over a CIK dict, not O(N²).
- UI (rendering 10k nodes), user portfolio upload, and live feeds remain separate,
  out of scope here.

## Alternatives considered

- **Per-CIK submissions fan-out** — rejected: ~10k requests violates SEC fair-access
  and buys deep data we explicitly don't want in the universe pass.
- **Key nodes by CIK/ticker** — rejected: violates Invariant #2 (surrogate PK); a
  ticker is reused across delisted issuers and an external ID must be an anchor.
- **Fabricate a coarse GICS from SIC now** — rejected: SIC↔GICS is lossy; label
  unresolved and defer to a clearly lower-authority follow-up.
- **Fuzzy-merge bulk issuers into curated nodes by name** — rejected: CIK is an exact
  key; name-fuzzing 10k issuers would risk over-merge for no benefit.

## Addendum — India (NSE + BSE), 2026-07-01

The seam's second market, added as a new provider with no rewrite — the point the
framework was built to prove.

- **`IndiaCoverageProvider`** unions the NSE `EQUITY_L.csv` and the BSE active-equity
  scrip list (its live JSON API *or* a CSV export) into one `IssuerRecord` **per ISIN**.
  A company listed on both exchanges shares one ISIN, so ISIN is both the intra-India
  dedup key and the NSE↔BSE join. `_MARKET_IDENTITY_SCHEME["IN"]="isin"`; the pipeline's
  generic `_anchor_index` already dedups on it (no code change to the reconciler).
  Surrogate `in-<isin>`, stable across re-runs.
- **Both exchange symbols ride on one node** — the NSE symbol becomes the `ticker`
  anchor (so `resolve.py` resolves an Indian book unchanged) and the numeric BSE code a
  `bse_code` anchor. `exchange` ∈ {NSE, BSE, `NSE & BSE`} so the dual-listed overlap
  (NSE∩BSE) is a first-class `by_exchange` bucket, not a hidden merge.
- **ADR ≠ domestic, never auto-merged.** The curated US-listed ADRs (`infy`, `wit`,
  `rdy`, …) are keyed by US ticker with a US ADR ISIN; the domestic NSE/BSE listing is
  a distinct identity (INFY, `INE009A01021`). Exact-ISIN dedup can't touch them and a
  fuzzy cross-market name-merge would over-merge — so the domestic node is created and
  ADR↔domestic reconciliation is deferred to the shared **GLEIF LEI** (both share one
  LEI → the reversible resolver clusters them once anchored — a separate step, not
  coverage's job). A resolver candidate for human review is left as optional follow-up.
- **Sector honesty holds.** India ≈ MSCI EM, but no per-company GICS/tier is fabricated
  (`gics_status: unresolved`); the coarse BSE Industry is deferred to a lower-authority
  enrichment.
- **ISIN resolution** added to `resolve.py` (Zerodha/Groww exports key by ISIN or NSE
  symbol); `parse_brokerage_csv` tolerances extended. Ticker → ISIN → org-name order.
- Wired as `coruscant coverage --market in [--nse --bse --nifty --sensex | --resolve]`,
  `run_coverage(market="in", sources=…)`. NSE blocks scripts (403), so the operator
  `--file` downloads are the primary path; the live fetch is best-effort with a
  browser-like UA (the NSE **archives** host + the BSE JSON API are script-reachable).
- Index membership (Nifty 50 / BSE Sensex) is recorded as `Index` nodes +
  `constituent_of` edges — see **ADR-0010**.

*Live-validated:* real NSE + BSE (JSON API) + Nifty lists → **5,035 India issuers**
(2,223 dual-listed, 130 NSE-only, 2,682 BSE-only; 32 non-equity/blank-ISIN excluded and
labelled) → graph 53 → **5,088 companies**; all 50 Nifty constituents linked; the ADR
`infy` and domestic `in-INE009A01021` verified distinct. A 12-line sample book resolved
**9/12 (75%)** — the three misses honest: a mutual fund (not a listed issuer), a bogus
symbol, and the post-demerger-retired `TATAMOTORS` symbol (present as TMCV/TMPV,
resolvable by ISIN — we do not fuzzy-match a retired ticker).

## Addendum — UK (LSE), 2026-07-01

The third and last target market, again a new provider with no seam change.

- **`UkLseCoverageProvider`** parses the LSE "List of all companies" CSV into one
  `IssuerRecord` **per ISIN** (`gb-<isin>`); `_MARKET_IDENTITY_SCHEME["GB"]="isin"`.
  `exchange` reflects the segment — `LSE Main Market` vs `LSE AIM`.
- **Identity set = ISIN / SEDOL / company-number (as anchors).** ISIN is the identity
  and dedup key; the TIDM becomes the `ticker` anchor (so `resolve.py` resolves a UK
  book unchanged); SEDOL and the Companies House number are attached **only when the
  export carries them** — absent columns yield no anchor, never a fabricated one
  (validated: BP carried all four, Shell only isin/ticker).
- **ADR ≠ domestic** (as with India): the curated UK ADRs (`bp`, `hsbc`, `shel`, `azn`,
  …, US-listed, keyed by US ticker, no GB ISIN anchor) stay distinct from the domestic
  LSE listing; exact-ISIN dedup can't touch them, and reconciliation flows through the
  shared GLEIF LEI. Cleaner than India here — the curated ADR nodes carry no ticker, so
  there is not even a ticker-index collision.
- **SEDOL resolution** added to `resolve.py` (UK exports — HL / AJ Bell — often key by
  SEDOL); precision order is now ticker → ISIN → SEDOL → org-name. `parse_brokerage_csv`
  gained SEDOL/TIDM/EPIC tolerances.
- **FTSE 100 / FTSE 250** are `Index` nodes + `constituent_of` edges (ADR-0010), the
  same generic shape as Nifty/Sensex — a second market exercising it.
- Wired as `coruscant coverage --market gb [--lse --ftse100 --ftse250 | --resolve]`
  (`uk` accepted as an alias for `gb`), `run_coverage(market="gb"/"uk", sources=…)`.

*Live constraint (honest):* the LSE site is JS-heavy and exposes no scriptable CSV
(confirmed: the report page returns an HTML shell; the instrument API is POST-only) — so
the operator `--lse` download is the primary path, exactly like NSE's 403. The mechanics
were live-validated on **verified-real FTSE mega-cap identifiers**: 15 real LSE issuers →
all 15 FTSE 100-linked; BP's full isin/ticker/sedol/company-number anchor set vs Shell's
isin/ticker only (no fabrication); the `bp`/`shel`/`vod`/`azn` ADRs verified distinct
from their domestic `gb-<isin>` nodes; a sample book resolved 5/7 by ticker/ISIN/SEDOL
(2 honest misses: a unit trust and a bogus symbol). The full-universe pull is operator-
driven by design.
